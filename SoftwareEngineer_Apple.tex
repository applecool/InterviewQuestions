\title{Apple Software Engineer Interview Questions}
\maketitle
\begin{itemize}
	\item Implement a peek using a existing iterator next and hasnext function.
	\item What is the difference between weak and strong pointers
	\item Reverse a linked list recursively
	\item Why can't you use primitives in a hashmap.
	\item Traverse a binary tree recursively.
	\item Write a basic Fibonacci sequence implementation. 
	\item How does delegation work?
	\item How does ARC work in Objective C, and how is it different from garbage collection?
	\item How would you design a data structure that is an array, but with so many elements such that the array almost fills up the entire RAM?
	\item How would you reverse a singly-linked list?
	\item What is the run time of a binary search tree.
	\item Find the most frequent element in an integer array.
	\item Is Java pass by value or pass by reference?
	\item What data structure would you use to auto complete a dialer when the phone may have thousands or hundreds of thousands of entries.
	\item Find the Kth largest number in an array.
	\item What is deadlock and how is it prevented? Intersection of two arrays with optimal Big O.
	\item What is the instruction used in Matlab to compute the standard deviation?
	\item Write a simple C++ algorithm involving standard input and output. Provide test cases.
	\item How do you design a system for detecting people around a door, predict whether this man will go into the door.
	\item Skyline problem.
	\item Given a set of interval tuples, find the longest overlapping interval.
	\item Given a huge log file of a web server, find the IP addresses that had exactly 1 request.
	\item A network is connected in a line, so that servers can talk only to the servers to their left or right. Servers know if they are the leftmost or rightmost servers. What's a protocol for every server to learn the full topology? How long does it take?
