\title{Apple Software Engineer Interview Questions}
\maketitle
\begin{itemize}
	\item Implement a peek using a existing iterator next and has-next function.
	\item What is the difference between weak and strong pointers
	\item Reverse a linked list recursively
	\item Why can't you use primitives in a hash-map.
	\item Traverse a binary tree recursively.
	\item Write a basic Fibonacci sequence implementation. 
	\item How does delegation work?
	\item How does ARC work in Objective C, and how is it different from garbage collection?
	\item How would you design a data structure that is an array, but with so many elements such that the array almost fills up the entire RAM?
	\item How would you reverse a singly-linked list?
	\item What is the run time of a binary search tree.
	\item Find the most frequent element in an integer array.
	\item Is Java pass by value or pass by reference?
	\item What data structure would you use to auto complete a dialer when the phone may have thousands or hundreds of thousands of entries.
	\item Find the K th largest number in an array.
	\item What is deadlock and how is it prevented? Intersection of two arrays with optimal Big O.
	\item What is the instruction used in Matlab to compute the standard deviation?
	\item Write a simple C++ algorithm involving standard input and output. Provide test cases.
	\item How do you design a system for detecting people around a door, predict whether this man will go into the door.
	\item Skyline problem.
	\item Given a set of interval tuples, find the longest overlapping interval.
	\item Given a huge log file of a web server, find the IP addresses that had exactly 1 request.
	\item A network is connected in a line, so that servers can talk only to the servers to their left or right. Servers know if they are the leftmost or rightmost servers. What's a protocol for every server to learn the full topology? How long does it take?
	\item Implement a queue using array or linked-list.
	\item What is polymorphism?
	\item How could you approximate a non-linear function with only multiplication and additions. 
	\item What are the techniques for allocating static and dynamic memory.
	\item Find the first non-repeated element in C.
	\item Given a binary search tree, print the nodes at each level on a separate line. With O (n) time complexity and O(1) space complexity.
	\item Describe the process of an interaction on a web page button from the click to the response.
	\item What is NTP and explain how TCP works?
	\item Given an iTunes type of an application that pulls down lots of images that get stale over time, what strategy would you use to flush disused images over time?
	\item Is there a difference between performSelector and a performSelector with delay of 0?
	\item Write a function to reverse a string.
	\item If you have 2 eggs, and you want to figure out what's the highest floor from which you can drop the egg without breaking it, how would you do it? What's the optimal solution?
	\item What is polymorphism?
	\item What does final keyword do in Java?
	\item How would you go through a list of country music words?
	\item Write code to find out the frequency of common words.
