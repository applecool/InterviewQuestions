\maketitle
\begin{itemize}
	\item What is POS (Part of Speech) tagging? What is the simplest approach to building a POS tagger that you can imagine?
	\item How would you train a model that identifies whether the word "Apple" in a sentence belongs to the fruit or the company?
	\item Design a recommendation system.
	\item What is latent semantic indexing and where can it be applied?
	\item How would you build a system that auto corrects text that has been generated by a speech recognition system?
	\item What is regular grammar? Does this differ in power to a regular expression and if so, in what way?
	\item How would you build a POS tagger from scratch given a corpus of annotated sentences? How would you deal with unknown words?
	\item How would you find all the occurrences of quoted text in a news article? 
	\item How would you build a system to translate English text to Greek and vice-versa?
	\item How would you build a system that automatically groups news articles by subject?
